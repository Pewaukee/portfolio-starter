export const spotifyDescription = `I used the Deezer API to create a clone of 
the popular music streaming service Spotify. You can search
for music, artists, and albums, and play them in the browser.
In this project, I understand the difficulties of
a fully functional state management system. I also studied the
complexities of front-end development, and learned how to use
Radix UI Components as well as my own custom elements to make a
unique UI experience for the user to enjoy.`;

export const stoicDescription = `I created a website for the Stoic Student Association, a club
at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I used the Next JS
framework to create a website that is easy to maintain and update
for the club. I also used the Tailwind CSS framework to create a
beautiful and responsive UI for the website. I learned a lot about
using custom font styles and creating a personalized asthetic for a brand.`;

export const templeDescription = `I help to maintain the Las Vegas ISKCON temple website. I have
worked on various new features, refactors, and improvements over the past couple months.
I have worked a lot on custom styling, which can be seen by the minor
adjustements throughout the website that bring it together. Furthermore, I sculpted a custom
color scheme to match a non-profit organization, in hopes to attract more visitors to the temple.
Lastly, accessibility was a main focus, both in terms of disabled users and mobile users, to make
sure everyone has a great experience.`;

export const websiteDescription = `In this project, I have learned and am continuing 
to learn much more about website development using 
the Next JS framework. I have also learned how to work 
with complex CSS styling and animations like framer 
motion and keyframe animations, all essential to 
making a website look more than simply a static page. 
It has been a fun journey so far, here's to more web dev!`;

export const modernShopperDescription = `I used selenium to create an automated shopping
experience from a command line interface. Using the 
Selenium WebDriver, I was able to put in a prompt for
 an item and get the most relevant results from Amazon's 
 database of millions of products. This project could be
  used as an API or as a way to more efficiently shop online. 
  With Chrome being automatically controlled, so much more 
  is possible!`;

export const tamilDescription = `I crafted a Machine Learning model to classify
  Tamil characters. I used a neural network of 3 convolutional blocks and a classifier head
  to identify 156 different possible characters. I learned about convolutional networks and how
  to apply them to real life problems. Tamil is also my mother tongue, so that's pretty cool!`;

export const lifeExpectancyDescription = `Consisting of a large batch of preliminary data
  analysis and preprocessing, I journied through an exploratory process of prediciting
  life expectancy with a neural network and a linear regression model. Some of the input 
  variables included trivial data such as alcohol consumption, BMI, and GDP, but also
  more intricate data like 'thinness 1-19 years', total expenditure on healthcare, and 
  a range of diseases like Hep B, Diphtheria, and more.`;

export const flowbiteDescription = `I created a new feature for the Flowbite-React UI
carousel component. Flowbite-React is an open source UI library with utility classes
from Tailwind CSS as a starting point for the building blocks of frontend development.
In this pull request, I added a new feature to the carousel component of rotating images: 
an option to pause. This provides better accessibility and a better developer
experience. If you would like to read more, please check out the PR with the 
external link button above. Below will be a demonstration of the feature. Simply hover 
your mouse or tap and hold on mobile to pause the carousel.`;

export const pentestDescription = `I used the Kali Linux operating system to perform
a series of penetration tests on vulnerable machines, in attempt to capture a flag on the system.
I used the OWASP Top Ten to find vectors for attack and used scanning tools like Nmap 
and directory busting tools like Dirbuster to enumerate the machines. I also learned
how to use metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to the machines. Overall,
I am a beginner in this field, but I am excited to learn more about the cyber offensive side soon!`
